Stack: Same concept as Next Greater Element with small modification.
Traversing arr from behind, if stack is empty, we push the num, map it -1 and continue, else if num < stack top elem, we pop all greater elems(since they are of no use) and map the rem elem or -1 if empty, else if num > stack top elem, we map the top elem with it. Don't forget to push num everytime.
