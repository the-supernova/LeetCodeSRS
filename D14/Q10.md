Stack: Push all ids into stack and pop top two ids and check for knows(a, b). If knows(a, b) is true, a knows b thus can't be a celebrity, where b can be a celebrity so push b. Else, a doesn't know b so check knows(b, a), if true, then a can be celebrity so push it. Do this till stack has a single element left. Now check for the single element, if by any chance, !knows(i, val) || knows(val, i) becomes true return -1, else return val at end
