Stack: Similar concept as Next Greater / Smaller Element, we find the left smaller and right smaller for every element and area will be calculated as (right idx - left idx + 1) * height(i). For left small, iterate from front and check if any smaller element is present, pop all the greater elements. If stack empty, set 0 else set top + 1. Also, same process for right small, iterate from back and set top - 1. Push idx of elem at every iteration.
