BFS: We need to remove fresh oranges in the range of every rotten orange, so we first iterate through the grid and count all oranges, also push rotten oranges indexes into queue. Until the queue is empty of all rotten oranges, count the days. For every iteration, take the size of queue and until sz > 0, we take every rotten orange in vector, pop it and for every direction of x and y {(-1,0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)}, make that index a rotten one and push to queue. At last, if cnt > 0(oranges are still left) return -1 else return days.
