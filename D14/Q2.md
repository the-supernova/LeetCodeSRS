List & Map: Initialise a list of pairs and a map with int and list iterator. When we use get(), the item moves to the front of list (using splice(begin(l), l, m(key))) as it is recently used. When we use put(), if elem already exist, we just move it to front like before and update the key-value. If max size is reached, we record the last key and pop_back from both list and map. Else we push new elem to front and set iterator to begin in map.
