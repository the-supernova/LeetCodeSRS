We use a priority queue to keep track of the node and the distance from the source vertex and keep a distance vector initialised to INT_MAX. For source vertex, distance will be 0, so we set it and push {dist, node} into queue and start the queue operation(until queue's not empty): store the dist and node and pop. Then for each neighbour of node, we capture their weight and update their dist if their current dist in distance vector is greater than the dist coming from source + their weight and if updated, we push them into queue. At last, we return dist.
