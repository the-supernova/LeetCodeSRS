**Using Prim's**
We need a key vector(set to INIT_MAX) to keep track of min weight, mst vector(set to false) to check whether node is included in mst and parent vector (set to -1 i.e no parents) to track their parents. For the initial node, we set its key and parent to 0. Further, we will be traversing through key again and again, finding the min key so instead we use a priority queue to help the TC. We push the initial key and node and continue the operation till its empty. We capture the node, then pop and update that node in our mst. Then for all neighbours, we capture weight and node. If the node is not a part of mst and weight is smaller than its key, we update its parent to the previous node and update key, then push key and node. Once we're finished, our mst is ready in parent vector with keys as their weights.

**Using Kruskal's**
We don't use adj here, we lay out u, v and the weight associated in a edges vector. Then we sort the edges w.r.t weights and for every edge, find if both nodes are of same component(their parents are the same). If not, union them and add the weight to cost. Now, find_parent and find_union functions are implemented through disjoint set logic. For find_parent, if the node is its parent, we return node else call the same function with parent(node) and update parent(node) along with it. For find_union, we generally union the parents so first find the parents of both nodes, then whichever node has higher rank, becomes the parent of the other node(for same rank, do anything just update any of the ranks).
