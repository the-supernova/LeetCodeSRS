We update the current adj through an operation, n - 1 times. For every mtrx(i)(j), we update if it is greater than mtrx(i)(k) + mtrx(k)(j) (this basically means we are checking distance from i to j through vertex k). If mtrx(i)(k) and mtrx(k)(j) are not -1 but mtrx(i)(j) is, mtrx(i)(j) = mtrx(i)(k) + mtrx(k)(j) else we update with the min of both.
