We keep a distance vector initialised with 1e8, dist for source will be 0. Then, for V - 1 times, we relax the edges i.e if dist(u) + wt < dist(v) then update dist(v). We got the shortest distance, but it can also detect -ve cycles. If we try to relax another time and if condition satisfies, then -ve cycle detected.
