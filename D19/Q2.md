?
The catch is, we should start with preorder(0) since its the root and this value when seen in inorder array, its left neighbours are its left subtree and same for right. So, first we store the indices of inorder elems in a map(to access root's left and right subtree). Then in recursive function, we create a new root node with rootval and store its index in imid. Now, root -> left of the new node will be from (start, imid - 1) and root -> right from (imid + 1, end).
