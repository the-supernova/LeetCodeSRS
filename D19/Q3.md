**Same as inorder and preorder one, with root -> right declared before root -> left**

We can confirm that last element of postorder array is our root, and for every root we get, we find the left and right subtree as left and right neighbours inorder array. So, recursively, we make an element from postorder array as root (backwards) and declare its right and left.
