We only need insert and containsAllPref function. The latter function checks whether for each char in string has its ref node flg true (indicates there is a string present for each prefix). In the main function, we just insert all strings into Trie and for all strings, we check for containsAllPref function and store longest (but lexicographically smallest) string.
