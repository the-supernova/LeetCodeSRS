Adhoc: First fix the string of addition spaces. For leading spaces, find the idx until which spaces exist and erase(0, idx). Then for trailing spaces, traverse from behind and find the idx until which spaces exist and erase(idx + 1, len). Finally, for multiple spaces, keep a k index and save every i into it, when space found, increment the idx until no space exists. Once we are free of spaces, then reverse the whole string then reverse each word(reverse between word starting idx and space idx)
