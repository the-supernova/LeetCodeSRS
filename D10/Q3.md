Pick / Non-pick approach : Traverse through board for empty cells. Then, try isValid function for chars 1 to 9 through a loop. If matches, pick it to the cell and call function. If returns true, return true else don't pick it to the cell. For isValid, check if char present in row(board(i)(col)), col(board(row)(i)) or cell(board(3 * (row / 3) + i / 3)(3 * (col / 3) + i % 3)).
