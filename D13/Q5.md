Stack: We need to find next greater element for every num in nums2 so that we can find in O(1), next greater element for every num in nums1. Traversing nums2 from behind, if stack is empty, we push the num, map it -1 and continue, else if num > stack top elem, we pop all smaller elems and map the bigger elem, else if num < stack top elem, we map the top elem with it. Don't forget to push num everytime.
