**BFS** : First we find the indegree of all vertices, by iterating through all their neighbors and incrementing, then push the vertices into queue with indegree = 0(those would be the first elems of the sort) and start the queue operation : we pop the top elem of queue, add it to topo, then for all neighbors decrease their indegree, if their indegree becomes 0, we push them to queue. Atlast, we return topo

**DFS** : For every vertex, we check for vis and call dfs, which marks the vertex and for all neighbors, calls dfs if not visited. After the work's done, we push the vertex into stack. The stack has the topo sort.
