**Using BFS**
?
We have to traverse in BFS fashion for all vertices, with a slight change. Instead of pushing only vertex, we push the vertex with its parent(previous node) and for its neighbors, we check for two things -> if its not visited, we mark and push to queue with the vertex as parent, else it is visited(it has been visited by the parent) and it is not parent, then we found the cycle and return true.
