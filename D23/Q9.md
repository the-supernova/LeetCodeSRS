**BFS** : Keep a color vector for all vertices, initially all are uncoloured(-1). For every vertex, if its not coloured, color with 1 and push into queue. For all its neighbors, check if they are coloured, color with !color(node) and push to queue, else if it has the same color as node, return false. Atlast return true
