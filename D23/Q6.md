If we detect a cycle in this directed graph, means we can't finish all courses.

**DFS** : Along with vis, we need a dfsVis to mark/unmark b/w dfs call. After creating adj, we check for each vertex, whether its visited and call dfs, which marks vis and dfsVis, then for all neighbors check whether any of them finds a cycle and return true, else we unmark dfsVis and return false.

**BFS** : We will try to find topological sort [[D23/Q7]] of the graph, if couldn't get all elems into topo sort(cnt == courses), it means the graph has a cycle(topo sort can be done on directed acyclic graphs)
