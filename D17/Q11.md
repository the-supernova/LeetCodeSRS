Level-order Traversal, but in this, we need to add node idx along with node in the queue so that for every iteration, we take the start idx and end idx and store the max (end - start + 1) into res. For left neighbours, 2 * idx + 1 and for right, 2 * idx + 2. After popping, set the idx as it.second - start.
