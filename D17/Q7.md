We need to visualise it in verticals and levels and iterate. For that, we take a map storing verticals and a map that stores levels and multiset of nodes in the current vertical and level. We perform level order traversal, in which we take a queue of pairs with node and a pair of vertical and level. While the queue is not empty, we pop the front elem, separately store the node, vertical and level, and insert the node val into the corresponding vertical and level (nodes(vertical)(level).insert(node -> val)). Then we push its left neighbour with (vertical - 1, level + 1) and right with (vertical + 1, level + 1). Finally, for every elem in map, we create a column vector and insert all the elem.second.second (this is pointing to multiset) elements into col and push the col into ans.
