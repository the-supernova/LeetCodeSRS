Stack: Create a stack storing node and a num and push {root, 1}. Until the stack is empty, we perform the following operations: Pop the top of stack, if num == 1, push the node val to preorder vector, increment num to 2 and push the node again. Since preorder needs its left neighbour(root -> left -> right), we also push its left with num 1. Similarly, if num == 2, push the node val to inorder vector, update num and push again. Since inorder needs its right neighbour(left -> root -> right), push its right with num 1. Else push it to postorder vector.
