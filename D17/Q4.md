Recursive: left -> right -> root
Iterative(two stacks): Push root into stack 1, pop it and push its neighbours while pushing it to stack 2, until stack is empty. Stack 2 has your answer.
Iterative(one stack): Same as pre-order swapping left and right; push root to stack, pop it and push its left and right neighbour while pushing it to ans. Reverse the ans
