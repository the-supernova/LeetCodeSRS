Binary Search: We know for a median, num of elems less than that should be n / 2. So we binary search for the median between the min and max val of the matrix. For every mid, we iterate in rows and count how many of them are less than or equal to mid through upper bound. If cnt <= n / 2 low = mid + 1 else high = mid - 1 return low.
