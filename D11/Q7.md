Binary Search: First we need to fix the search space. Min case would be the max num with one student and rest of the nums with another (max since we want the sum to be min possible), max case would be the sum of all nums. Binary search through the search space to find the limit feasible for B students. Every value of mid will be checked by another function which adds books till mid then allocates to new student, like this total no of students used will be counted. If cnt > B, we need to increase limit else the limit is feasible and we store as ans but also look for a lower limit.
