Binary Search: Notice that for duplicate nums, first of them is placed at even idx, other one at the odd idx. So find the mid where this pattern is not followed. Reducing search space is simple, if mid follows the pattern implies that nums before mid also follow the same thus low = mid + 1, if mid doesn't follow, nums after mid also won't follow thus high = mid - 1.
