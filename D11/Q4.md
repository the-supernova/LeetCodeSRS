Binary Search: To perform the ordinary binary search, we want the nums(mid) and target to be at the same side(left or right). First check this by comparing both with nums(0) { nums(mid) < nums(0) == target < nums(0) }. If true, perform normal BS, else make the pointer skip the side opposite to target (if target on right side, low = mid + 1 else high = mid - 1)
