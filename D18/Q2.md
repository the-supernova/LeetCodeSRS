Same process as levelOrder traversal, but with a leftToRight flg maintained. For every queue iteration, we initialise a row vector of the queue size and if the current order is leftToRight, we store val in ith index else sz - i - 1 th index. After every iteration, we switch the flg val and push the row into res.
